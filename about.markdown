Hey!

I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com/), aiming to
provide affordable, high quality fitness at home.  I build tools 
for generating playlists, recording and translating instructions at scale, and generally making things more efficient.


I also try to help [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapworld.org/) with their mission of providing 
rigorous, high quality math and computer science education to everyone for free.  I wrote the first version of 
Bootstrap Data Science, which is now being taught across the US.

In my spare time, you can find me playing soccer chess or rocket league.  Or re-learning Claire De Lune on piano.
