Last time, I omitted the most important part of the media junk food diary; the media junk food.  So this time, 
I'll also include how many hours I spent on twitter, to hopefully cut down on that.  Also, after reviewing the post from
March, I remember much more content from the articles/media that I actually wrote about.  So this month, I'll write about every
single thing I read or watch, even if it's just a summary.

### [Advice to Startup Founders and Employees: Strength Doesnâ€™t Always Come in Numbers](https://chamath.substack.com/p/advice-to-startup-founders-and-employees) (Chamath Palihapitiya)
### [The index mindset](https://luttig.substack.com/p/indexmindset) (John Luttig)
 - Very roughly, the index mindset is a preference for diversification & an aversion towards
   concentrated bets, to minimize the possibility of loss.
 - Luttig argues that recent technology improvements have proliferated the index mindset in markets outside of the 
   stock market, including employment and dating markets.

### [How Your Nervous System Works & Changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM) (Andrew Huberman)
### [Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake](https://youtu.be/nm1TxQj9IsQ) (Andrew Huberman)
### [Sleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2aWYjSA1Jc)
 - I'm not a great sleep haver, and am trying to change that.  Feels especially important to learn about
   since we want to offer a great Sleep experience with Down Dog.
 - There are 3 critical Periods during the day, the first being morning (first 3 hours):
    - Light:  Get sunlight in the first 30-60 minutes after waking up (not phone light, no sunglasses).  5+ mins on sunny day, 10+ on cloudy, 20+ completely overcast.  Do it 80+% of the time, and make it enjoyable!
    - Temperature:  1-3 minute cold shower when you wake up, _increases_ core body temperature and wakes you up faster
    - Exercise: Exercise 5+ days per week, works well if you pair it with light in the morning.
    - Caffeine: Delay intake 90-120 minutes after waking up to avoid the afternoon crash
    - Food:  Avoid eating huge meals early in the day (either fast or eat small meal early in the morning)
    - Pairing techniques & routine will reinforce and train the body to expect routine
 - Second period is middle of the day -> afternoon, or work day:
    - Light:  Get some sunlight in your eyes when the sun is low
    - Caffeine: Avoid consuming too much 
    - Naps: Fine (optional), but don't sleep too long/too late that it disrupts night time sleep.
    - Huberman uses the Reveri app, and loves Yoga Nidra, to do Non Sleep Deep Relaxation in the afternoon
    - Exercise:  Intense exercise in the afternoon will delay the circadian clock, so slightly worse than morning workout
 - Third period:  Late evening (hours leading to sleep)
    - Light:  Avoid artificial light of any color, use as little as possible.  If you see evening sunset, it'll offset some negative affects of late artificial light
    - Temperature: warm shower/sauna will cool you off before bed.  Make your sleeping environment cooler
    - Caffeine (alcohol, THC, CBD) - Just don't do it, greatly disrupts sleep
    - Exercise:  Avoid (for same reasons as second period)
    - Supplements: Fine (optional) 30-60 before bedtime, avoid melatonin because of dosages.  Huberman uses inositol
    - Behavioral tools: NSDR, Yoga Nidra, The Reveri app for getting back to sleep
    - Physical tools: Eye masks work as long as they're not too tight / too warm, ear plugs work sometimes.  Elevating your feet can be beneficial if no acid reflux.
 - Breathing should be nasal; train to breath through your nose while exercising can translate to breathing nasally through sleep.
 - Weekends: Try to be consistent with sleep and wake times, avoid differences > 1 hour.  Better to wake up consistently and nap later in the day if the nap isn't too long.  Definitely avoid caffeine 90-120 minutes, it disrupts compensatory/makeup sleep.
