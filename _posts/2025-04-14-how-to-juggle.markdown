### How To Juggle (Part 1)

1.  Search 'how to juggle' on YouTube.  Watch several different peoples' videos to get a sense for what they do similarly, what they do differently.  Make sure to watch the recommended videos of people doing more complicated things like juggling 7 balls, doing tricks, etc. to get excited about your future abilities.

2.  Notice that each demo video has different juggling balls.  Before you start, make sure to buy the best possible set for beginners.  Search juggling balls on amazon, and spend at least 15 minutes reading reviews to get a sense for the best option.  You can also use YouTube for this.

3.  It's important to have a mentor; eventually you'll need an expert's help to learn the more advanced techniques.  Aggregate the contact information of all the YouTubers whose tutorials you watched, and reach out to them.  Generally speaking, if you cold email people on the internet, you'll get a response less than 10% of the time, so it's important to build up a decent sized roster.  I recommend at least 25 people to start.

4.  People are busy, and you might not get responses right away, so be persistent.  Write first, second, and third round emails to send to your potential mentors if they don't respond.  There's software you can use to do this automatically; it will have a learning curve, but should save time in the long run.

5.  If you're lucky your mentor will live close to you, but most likely they'd coach you remotely.  So you'll need an at home video recording setup for them to observe and correct your technique.  Start by finding the most cost effective video recording equipment, and purchase several cameras you can set up at different angles for more complete coverage.

6.  Video equipment is expensive, but you can offset the cost by making your own juggling YouTube videos to generate ad revenue.  Use ChatGPT or another AI model to brainstorm names for your channel.

7.  Another way to offset your video costs is partnerships; you can be an affiliate to sell juggling gear to your audience.  Go back to Amazon and aggregate the names of all the companies that sell juggling balls.  Once you set up your YouTube channel and website (I recommend Squarespace, ideally with a .com domain), reach out to those companies using the same techniques you used for the mentors.  Here's where your email scheduling software will start paying off.

8.  You'll need the right outfit for both the YouTube videos and your personal practice.  Spend at least 45 minutes designing your cap and bells.  You can use AI tools to generate multiple versions and hone in on the best color combinations for your brand.  For example, my cap is yellow, red, cyan, purple, white, and orange, and my collar is green.

9.  Anytime you get the chance, in conversation with friends or family, let them know you're learning how to juggle.  Generally people love to hear that you're planning to do something cool, and they'll encourage you to do it.  This positive feedback will only motivate you to practice more.

After following these steps, you'll be almost halfway ready to pick up a ball!
