I want to start this up again, but tracking time on Twitter is too annoying; I'd rather just cut it out except for particular times of day.
The new criteria for this list is anything I read where I make it to the end.

### [Duolingo Cuts 10% of Contractors as It Uses More AI to Create App Content](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-08/duolingo-cuts-10-of-contractors-in-move-to-greater-use-of-ai)
When the news first broke on reddit I tried and failed for 15 minutes to verify the claims that Duolingo had laid off "most of their translators".  The only primary source was a translator saying they were on a team of 4 translators that had been reduced to 2.  I'm surprised that such a beloved brand was scorned so harshly so immediately by people on twitter / reddit.

Also very interested to see Duolingo's internal tools for translation QA, since I built Down Dog's translation QA tools.

### [Sweaty January and how gyms make money](https://medium.com/bull-market/sweaty-january-and-how-gyms-make-money-7d682ff5eeaf)
Roughly 18% of yearly memberships to Down Dog start in January, which is a lot but far from the author's claim of 75% of new gym memberships starting in January.  There's no citation, but I'm curious if online fitness has a less pronounced spike than in person because it's easier to get started from home.  But a good write up of the slightly perverse incentives for gyms.

### [An app can be a home cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)
Love this piece, I want all my Computer Science classmates turned professional software engineers to read it.  Here are some homecooked software projects I've worked on this year:
 - My custom built [Tiller HQ](https://www.tillerhq.com/) budget spreadsheet.  Built from scratch, takes me ~2 hours per year to categorize / set up rules, and gives me an easy yearly overview.  Also helps keep track of total charitable contribution, which is useful for taxes.
 - A rebalancing program; given a list of stock tickers, prices, target allocations, and current allocations, output the number of shares to buy for each asset to reach target allocation.  Works great for me since I tend to do lump sum investing rather than DCA.

I have more home cooked software project ideas, for when I'm less busy with Down Dog, might write about those soon.


### [The Real Differences Between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers, and Silents - and What They Mean for America's Future](https://www.amazon.com/Generations-Differences-Millennials-Silents_and-Americas/dp/1982181613)

Originally inspired to read this because I straddle the Millenial - Gen Z divide, and am dating a Gen Z woman.  I'm also curious about the trends for even younger generations, which might be relevant when I start a family.  Here are the most prescient excerpts:
