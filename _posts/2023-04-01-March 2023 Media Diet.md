I started using MyFitnessPal to track what I eat, which (so far) has reduced my junkfood intake.  
The best way to not eat 5 lindor truffles after lunch is to eat 5 lindor truffles after lunch, then write down in a food diary that you ate 5 lindor truffles after lunch, then just shudder.

So now I'm trying to track my media diet; hopefully it'll make me more cognizant of consuming "media junk food".

# Referral & Retention in consumer software
Since 2015 [Down Dog](https://downdogapp.com/)'s marketing has been almost entirely word of mouth.  This year, I've built several referral systems, with the goal that eventually they can account for 10% of our new signups.  

What we've built so far:
 - Affiliate Marketing:  Select social media influencers join our payroll, then get a cut of sales from users who they refer to Down Dog
 - User to User Referrals:  Current unsubscribed users can extend their free trial by referring friends (who also get an extended free trial)
 - Promotional links:  Issue special links to organizations where referred users get extended free trials
