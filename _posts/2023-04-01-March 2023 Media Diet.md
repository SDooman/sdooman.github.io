I've use MyFitnessPal to track what I eat, which has had a positive effect that I'm 
eating less junk food.  The best way to not eat 3 lindor truffles after lunch is to 
do that, and then write it into a food diary and shudder.

So now I'm tracking my media diet, to hopefully be more cognizant when consuming media junk food.
